According to the first, the words read:

    MY BELOVED KNOWS MY HEART,
    MY BELOVED IS SWEET AS HONEY,
    SHE IS AS FRAGRANT TO THE NOSE AS WINE,
    THE FRUIT OF MY FEELINGS -, POEM

MS in Old Babylonian on clay, Babylonia, 18th c. BC, 1 tablet, 11,0x5,7 cm, 23 lines in cuneiform script.

Commentary: So far a unique love poem, without parallels for this early period.
