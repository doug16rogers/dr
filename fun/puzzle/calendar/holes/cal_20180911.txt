HOLES

Locate 12 holes in the empty cells of
this grid. The numbers outside the
grid indicate the number of holes in
each row or column. Each arrow in the
grid points directly toward one or more
of the holes. An arrow may be immediately
next to the hole it points to, or all the way
across the grid. Not every hole will
necessarily have an arrow pointing to it.
Can you locate the 12 holes?
