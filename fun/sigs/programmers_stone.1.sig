Checking that a proposed deep structure is real and not
just a coincidence is very important. If a designer
exploits a coincidence, the result will be 'clever'
rather than 'elegant', and it will be fragile, liable to
explode into special cases provisions all over the
resulting system code, with all design integrity lost.
