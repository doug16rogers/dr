Nether branch of the legislative department, still less
any merely administrative body, established by
congress, possesses, or can be invested with, a general
power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the
citizen. We said in Boyd v. US...and it cannot be too
often repeated - that the principles that embody the
essence of constitutional liberty and security forbid
all invasions on the part of government and its
employees of the sanctity of a man's home and the
privacies of his life. [ICC v Brimson 154 USC 447
(1894)]
