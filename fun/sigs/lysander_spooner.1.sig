... whoever desires liberty should understand
these vital facts, viz.: 1. That every man who
puts money in the hands of a "government" (so
called), puts into its hands a sword which will
be used against himself, to extort more money
from him, and also to keep him in subjection to
its arbitrary will. 2. That those who will take
his money, without his consent, in the first
place, will use it for his further robbery and
enslavement, if he presumes to resist their
demands in the future. [Lysander Spooner]
