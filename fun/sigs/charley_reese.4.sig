It was the invention of firearms that ultimately ended
the practice of professional warriors being the ruling
class...  It seems as self-evident to me as it was to
the Founding Fathers that a people disarmed by their
government cannot purport to be free. The bottom line
remains: Force rules. Therefore, if you allow the
government to have a monopoly on force, then you can
never purport to be a free person. [Charley Reese, The
Orlando Sentinel, 2000.04.18]
