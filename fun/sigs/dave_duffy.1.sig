The stupid have no idea how humanity got this
far, how we went from a subsistence economy to
America's system of bounty and relative happiness
for nearly everyone. They only see the knave
politician soliciting their greed and laziness.
They can't understand the great struggle that
produced America, but they readily grasp the
concept of voting themselves unearned goodies.
