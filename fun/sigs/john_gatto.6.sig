Violence, narcotic addictions, divorce,
alcoholism, loneliness...all these are but
tangible measures of a poverty in education.
Surely schools, as the institutions monopolizing
the day-times of childhood, can be called to
account for this. In a democracy the final judges
cannot be experts, but only the people. [John
Gatto, "Bootie Zimmer's Choice"]
