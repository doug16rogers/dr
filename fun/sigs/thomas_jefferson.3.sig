Our government is now taking so steady a course
as to show by what road it will pass to
destruction; to wit: by consolidation first and
then corruption, its necessary consequence. The
engine of consolidation will be the Federal
judiciary; the two other branches the corrupting
and corrupted instruments. [Thomas Jefferson to
Nathaniel Macon, 1821]
