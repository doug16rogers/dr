The doctrine of 'majority rule equals freedom' is
custom made to turn mobs of voters into spoiled
children with a divine right to plunder the candy
store. The only way to equate submission to
majority-sanctioned decrees is to assume that
individuals have no right to live in any way that
displeases the majority. [James Bovard, _Freedom
in Chains_]
