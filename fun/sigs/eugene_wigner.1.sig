All the laws of nature are conditional statements
which permit a prediction of some future events
on the basis of the knowledge of the present,
except that some aspects of the present state of
the world, in practice the overwhelming majority
of the determinants of the present state of the
world, are irrelevant from the point of view of
the prediction. [Eugene Wigner, "The Unreasnable
Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural
Scienes"]
