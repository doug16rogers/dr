In all experience, the accumulation of wealth
means the multiplication of schools, the increase
of knowledge, the dissemination of intelligence,
the encouragement of science, the broadening of
outlook, the expansion of liberties, the widening
of culture. [Calvin Coolidge, Foundations of the
Republic, 1926]
