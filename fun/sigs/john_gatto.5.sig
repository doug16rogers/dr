When Frederich Froebel, the inventor of
kindergarten in 19th century Germany fashioned
his idea he did not have a "garden for children"
in mind, but a metaphor of teachers as gardeners
and children as the vegetables. Kindergarten was
created to be, and was quietly celebrated as, a
way to break the influence of mothers on their
children once and for all. [John Gatto, "Bootie
Zimmer's Choice"]
