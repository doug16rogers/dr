To lay with one hand the power of the government
upon the property of the citizen and with the
other to bestow it upon favored individuals to
aid private enterprises and build up private
fortunes is none the less a robbery because it is
done under the forms of law and is called
taxation. [U.S. Supreme Court, S & L Association
v. Topeka (?)]
