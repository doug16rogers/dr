There is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in
the idea of danger to liberty from the militia, that
one is at a loss ... whether to consider it as a ...
disingenuous artifice to instil prejudices at any
price... Where in the name of common-sense, are our
fears to end if we may not trust our sons, our
brothers, our neighbors, our fellow-citizens? What
shadow of danger can there be from men who are daily
mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who
participate with them in the same feelings, sentiments,
habits and interests? [Hamilton, Federalist Papers #29,
1788.01.10]
