After the unrepentant drug dealer explained his
philosophy, Sergeant Joe Friday replied, "If everyone
thought the way you do, we'd have anarchy, the law of
the jungle." Friday always has the last word. ... I
might quibble with his definition of anarchy, but I
have to thank him for pointing out that the jungle has
its laws too. Maybe these laws are not as harsh as you
suppose. Maybe the jungle laws are the only real laws
there are. [Willy Chaplin, _Laws of the Jungle_]
