It matters little if or whether we were created or to
what extent ... we humans are 'in' a creation, and no
matter how impressive the creator claims to be, or how
infinite Her mortal representatives claim Her to be. 
We _still_ must, and do, whether we admit it or not,
evaluate the efficacy of those claims and the morality
of the creator.  How do we determine if it's a message
from God or a directive from an twisted alien?  In the
Bible, He _tells us_ what he intends to do with most of
humanity.  What more information do we need? [Jim Wyman
