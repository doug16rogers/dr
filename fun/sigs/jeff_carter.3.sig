Frequently it is claimed that technical decisions
by non-technical managers are to blame [for the
failure of large gov't programs]. I, however,
have come to think that such projects are the
result of a finely tuned optimization technique
finding the saddle point between 2 conflicting
constraints: on the 1 hand, the desire to extract
as much money as possible from the gov't; on the
other hand, not having the project fail so badly
that the gov't won't give you other projects.
