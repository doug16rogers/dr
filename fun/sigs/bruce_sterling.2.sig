Before many more decades pass, the human race will
begin to obtain what it really wants. Then we will find
ourselves confronted ... with visions of power and
ability that have previously existed only in myth. Our
aspirations will become consequences. That's when our
*real* trouble starts. [Bruce Sterling, The Manifesto
of January 3, 2000]
