Those who profess to favor freedom yet deprecate
agitation are men who want the crops without plowing up
the ground. They want rain without thunder. They want
the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.
... Power concedes nothing without demand. It never has
and never will. ... The limits of tyrants are
prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppose.
[Frederick Douglass]
