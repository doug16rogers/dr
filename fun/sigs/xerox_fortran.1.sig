The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give
names to constants; instead of referring to pi as
3.141592653589793 at every appearance, the variable PI
can be given that value with a DATA statement and used
instead of the longer form of the constant.  This also
simplifies modifying the program, should the value of
pi change. [FORTRAN manual for Xerox Computers]
