The [...] advocated [handgun ban] is one of the most
absurd specimens of jackass legislation ever heard of,
even in this paradise of legislative donkeyism. Its
single and sole effect would be to exaggerate
enormously all of the evils it proposes to put down. It
would not take pistols out of the hands of rogues and
fools; it would simply take them out of the hands of
honest men. [H. L. Mencken, The Baltimore Evening Sun,
1925]
