I haven't yet seen [a holy book] that doesn't
have some apparent contradictions regarding
conduct in it. Those contradictions may disappear
with the proper interpretation; but who provides
the interpretation? You'll do it yourself or
you'll select someone to provide it for you. In
either case, _you_ have become the authority for
making the choice. [Harry Browne, _How I Found
Freedom in an Unfree World_]
