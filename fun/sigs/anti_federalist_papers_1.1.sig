The Lawyers in particular, keep up an incessant
declamation for [the Constitution's] adoption; like
greedy gudgeons they long to satiate their voracious
stomachs with the golden bait. The numerous tribunals
to be erected by the new plan of consolidated empire,
will find employment for ten times their present
numbers; these are the LOAVES AND FISHES for which they
hunger. They will probably find it suited to THEIR
HABITS, if not to the HABITS OF THE PEOPLE. [The
Antifederalist Papers #1 1787.11.26]
