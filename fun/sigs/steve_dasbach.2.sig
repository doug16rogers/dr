There's a reason why police aren't setting up random
roadblocks to find people who have been the victims of
robbery or a violent crime. In those kinds of cases,
people go to the police to seek justice. But with drug
and seatbelt laws, there is no victim to complain --
just people engaging in consensual behavior that harms
no one but themselves. [Steve Dasbach]
