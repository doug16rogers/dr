The irony is that you pay a _lesser_ price when
you accept the existence of the social disorders
and deal with them individually. You pay a
_higher_ price when you work to create a better
society (through education, politics, etc.). ...
Changing the social structure won't change [for
the better] the prices you'll have to pay to get
and keep what you want. [Harry Browne, _How I
Found Freedom in an Unfree World_]
