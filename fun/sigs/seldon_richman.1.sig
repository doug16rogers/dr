For centuries, governments used capricious force
against common people, preventing them from producing
wealth. When the rulers retrenched, people felt secure
enough to work and invest with the hope of reaping
profits. No one does that if he thinks his profits will
be confiscated. Feeling secure in their property,
people developed an elaborate division of labor,
expanded trade, and created wealth. Living standards
rose dramatically. It was all the result of human
ingenuity released by freedom, private property, and
limits on political power. [Seldon Richman]
