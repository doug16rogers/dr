Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear
-- kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor
-- with the cry of grave national emergency...  Always
there has been some terrible evil to gobble us up if we
did not blindly rally behind it by furnishing the
exorbitant sums demanded. Yet, in retrospect, these
disasters seem never to have happened, seem never to
have been quite real. [Gen. Douglas MacArthur, 1957]
