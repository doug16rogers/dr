The 1928 [German Law on Firearms and Ammunition] was
enacted ... to curb "gang activity," violent street
fights between Nazi party and Communist party thugs.
All firearm owners and their firearms had to be
registered. Sound familiar? Gun control did not save
democracy in Germany. It helped to make sure that the
toughest criminals, the Nazis, prevailed. [Jews for the
