The powers of the sword are in the hands of the
yeomanry of America from sixteen to sixty. The militia
of these free commonwealths, entitled and accustomed to
their arms, when compared with any possible army, must
be tremendous and irresistible. Who are the militia?
Are they not ourselves? ... Congress have no power to
disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other
terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright
of an American. ... The unlimited power of the sword is
not in the hands of either the federal or state
governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever
remain, in the hands of the people. [Tench Coxe, PA
Gazette 1788.02.20]
