When something as terrible as Columbine's tragedy
occurs, politicians immediately look for a scapegoat
such as the NRA. They immediately seek to pass more
restrictive laws that continue to erode away our
personal and private liberties. Political posturing and
restrictive legislation are not the answer. [Darrell
Scott, father of a victim at Columbine High School]
