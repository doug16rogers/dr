Even when the actions of others affect me
directly, I know that there are many alternatives
available to me... I can let each person be
himself, do as he chooses, learn what he wants to
learn, go where he wants to go. I have no duty to
restrain him. _What a relief!_ [Harry Browne,
_How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World_]
