Whether we are surveilled by our government, by
criminals, or by our neighbors, it is fair to say that
never has our ability to shield our affairs from prying
eyes been at such a low ebb. The availability and use
of secure encryption may offer an opportunity to
reclaim some portion of the privacy we have lost.
[Ninth Circuit Judge Betty Fletcher]
