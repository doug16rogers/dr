Americans ... stillbelieve that their government
has power to do anything it wants. I fear that
they will try harder, ever more desperately, to
apply that "power" to fix an ever worsening
situation. I fear they will not see the folly
till they see that the "power" is empty. That
will be when, I fear, the state is near collapse,
and not before. [Richard O. Hammer, "Toward A
Free Nation", 1993.01]
