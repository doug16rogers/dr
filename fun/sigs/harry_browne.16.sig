I'm not suggesting that government be run like a
business. It can't be done. Business operates
efficiently by gaining the willing cooperation of
everyone involved, but government runs on
coercion. Instead, the government should post a
reward of $50 billion (or some other sum) for a
_working_ missile defense. Not an idea, not a
plan, but an actual demonstration. [Harry Browne,
_Why Government Doesn't Work_]
