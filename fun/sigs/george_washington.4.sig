Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have
none or a very remote relation. Hence she must be
engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which
are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence
therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate
ourseves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary
vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary
combinations and collisions of her friendships, or
enmities. [George Washington, Sep., 1796]
