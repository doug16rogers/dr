In May of 1792, five months *after* the adoption
of the 2nd Amendment, the Militia Act was passed.
That act distinguished between the enrolled
militia and the organized militia. Before [then],
there was only the enrolled militia, which was
[...] all able-bodied men between the ages of 17
and 44, inclusively, and it is that militia to
which the 2nd Amendment refers. The 2nd Amendment
was to ensure that this body of citizens is
armed. [John Silveira, _Backwoods Home Magazine_,
July 1999]
