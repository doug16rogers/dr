Somewhere around the turn of the 20th century,
making people dumb for their own good became the
point of our national forced schooling exercise.
If you find that hard to believe, use the
evidence of your own eyes and ears to confirm it.
Do you think you can find a better way to teach?
You're right, of course you can --but not a
better way to teach obedience. [John Gatto,
"Bootie Zimmer's Choice"]
