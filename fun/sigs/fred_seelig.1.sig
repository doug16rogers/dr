Did you ever go shooting at a target range?  You get
your target paper... [and] everybody looks at everybody
else's. The most interesting targets are those with the
holes in a tight center, but just off center.  It shows
that the guy can shoot well, and consistently, but it's
just that he doesn't want to hit the same target that
everyone else does. [Fre(e)d Seelig]
