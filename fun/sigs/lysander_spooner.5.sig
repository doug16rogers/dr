Those who deny the right of a jury to protect an
individual in resisting an unjust law of government,
deny him all legal defence whatsoever against
oppression. [Without this right,] forcible resistance
to the injustice of the government is the only possible
means of preserving liberty. [Lysander Spooner, _Trial
by Jury_]
