To remove the "Application was downloaded from the Internet" warning, use the following:

sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <application-file>

Often <application-file> will be /Applications/Emacs.app, or something like that.
To remove the quarantine attribute on all the files in ~/Downloads, use:

sudo xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads

This will have to repeated when a new file is downloaded, assuming it is being run
from there. It's also possible to stop the warning system entirely (not recommended)
using:

defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool NO

followed by a reboot.
